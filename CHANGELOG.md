# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-09

API-parity release: closes the gaps between the public Memory API and the MCP
surface that an agent actually hits. Every new request field is sent only when
set, so older API servers (which reject unknown properties) are unaffected.

### Added
- **`polarity` on `memory_add` and `memory_update`.** Writer-declared polarity
  beats the server's phrasing classifier — policy register ("No integrations
  before FY27") reads neutral to a heuristic. Tag hard constraints
  `"negative"` at write time so `memory_search { polarity: "negative" }` can
  pull them later. This completes the constraint loop that 0.3.2 opened on the
  read side.
- **`memory_answer`** — the cited-answer pipeline (`POST /v1/answer`):
  question in, synthesized answer + citations out, instead of raw chunks.
  Citations default ON (server-side); `mode: "fast"` answers in ~1-2s, default
  `"full"` runs the deep pipeline (with a 90s client budget instead of the
  default 30s).
- **`document_add` + `job_status`** — async document ingestion
  (`POST /v1/documents`, `GET /v1/jobs/{id}`): transcripts, pages, notes up to
  500,000 characters; extraction runs in the background, poll `job_status`
  until `completed`. Re-ingesting the same `customId` updates instead of
  duplicating.
- **`memory_restore`** — undo for `memory_delete` during the recovery window
  (`POST /v1/memories/{id}/restore`).

Bare-id routes are API-key sessions only: `memory_restore` and `job_status`
carry no container field for the API to check against an OAuth grant's
allowed set (the API denies MCP principals on restore outright; the jobs
route is workspace-keyed). Neither tool is listed to hosted-OAuth sessions,
and — because listing is discovery, not authorization — a direct `tools/call`
to them (or to any API-key-only personal tool) from an OAuth session is
refused before any API request is made.
- **`searchMode`, `excludeIds`, `mode` on `memory_search`** — search documents
  vs memories vs both, omit already-seen ids when paginating/deduplicating,
  and opt into the `precise` retrieval pipeline.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-09-05

### Added
- **`polarity` filter on `memory_search`.** Optional `"positive" | "negative" |
  "neutral"` param, mapped to `/v1/search`'s polarity filter. Server-side it
  restricts results to that polarity **with coverage**: matching-polarity
  memories in scope are returned even when the query never mentions them
  (stamped `metadata.polarityCoverage: true`). Use `polarity: "negative"` to
  pull the standing hard constraints before acting on a plan or proposal.
  The field is only sent when set, so older API servers (which reject unknown
  properties) are unaffected.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-09-04

Fixes found while integrating Mnemo into a real third-party project (AI-SHIPR).

### Fixed
- **`GETMNEMO_WORKSPACE_ID` is no longer required.** The API derives the tenant
  from the API key, and `x-workspace-id` was retired in SDK 0.5.1. The server now
  starts without it and only sends the header when a workspace is explicitly
  configured. Requiring it forced every integrator to hunt for an id the platform
  no longer needs.
- **The startup error names the variable that is actually missing.** It used to
  say "missing GETMNEMO_API_KEY and/or GETMNEMO_WORKSPACE_ID", which sends you to
  debug the wrong one.

### Added
- **`whoAmI()`** on the API client, backed by the new `GET /v1/whoami`. Resolves
  the workspace, key id/label and granted scopes from the key itself, so a
  workspace id never has to be configured by hand. Requires no scope.

### Notes
- `memory_timeline` previously failed with `403 Key missing required scope(s):
  timeline:read` for most keys. The root cause was in the API's default scope set
  (a standard key was missing read scopes a read-only key had) and is fixed
  there; it takes effect for keys minted after that API deploy.

All notable changes to `getmnemo-mcp` are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- Personal-memory tools against Mnemo API v0.3.0: `daily_brief`, `memory_timeline`,
  `people_list`, `people_get`, `people_upsert`, `reminder_create`, `reminders_upcoming`,
  `reminder_complete`, `meetings_upcoming`, `meeting_brief`, `memory_merge`.
- Every new tool description names the API-key scope(s) it needs and the
  `MEMORY_API_*` deployment flag; `503 FEATURE_DISABLED` and `403` (missing scope /
  hosted-OAuth token) map to tool errors that say exactly that. Stable API error
  codes (`PERSON_NOT_FOUND`, `NOT_A_REMINDER`, `MERGE_PROTECTED`, ...) are surfaced
  verbatim; `MnemoApiError.code` exposes them programmatically.
- `people_upsert` composes `POST /v1/people` + `PATCH /v1/people/{slug}` (create, then
  update on `409 PERSON_EXISTS`; with an explicit `slug`, update then create on 404).
- `createServer(cfg, { principal })`: hosted OAuth sessions no longer list the
  API-key-only tools (the API denies MCP tokens on cross-container routes);
  `memory_timeline` stays available to them.
- `MnemoApiClient` methods for the new surface; `personal-types.ts` wire types
  re-exported from the package root.
- ESLint flat config (`typescript-eslint`, mirrors `getmnemo-js`) so `npm run lint` runs.

### Changed
- Server version advertised in the MCP handshake is now `0.3.0` (`SERVER_VERSION`,
  pinned to `package.json` by a test).

## [0.2.0]

- Per-call container targeting via `X-Mnemo-Container`; all/multi-container hosted
  OAuth grants; full scope set advertised in the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge.
